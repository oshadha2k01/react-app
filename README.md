## Troubleshooting OAuth2 Issues

### Common Issues and Solutions:

1. **"Google Login Failed" Error**
   - Ensure all Firebase environment variables are correctly set
   - Check that Google Sign-In is enabled in Firebase Console
   - Verify your domain is authorized in Firebase Authentication settings

2. **"Popup was blocked" Error**
   - Allow popups for your domain in browser settings
   - Try using a different browser
   - Check if ad-blockers are interfering

3. **"Unauthorized domain" Error**
   - Add your domain to authorized domains in Firebase Console
   - For localhost: add `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`
   - For production: add your Vercel domain

4. **Environment Variables Not Working**
   - Restart your development server after adding `.env` file
   - For Vercel: redeploy after adding environment variables
   - Ensure variable names start with `REACT_APP_`

5. **Firebase Configuration Issues**
   - Double-check your Firebase project settings
   - Ensure the Firebase project is in the correct region
   - Verify API keys and project IDs match

### Getting Firebase Configuration:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Click the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) next to "Project Overview"
4. Select "Project settings"
